<p>Every No Shock team member is a Certified Electrician, which means you always have a fully-qualified registered electrician working on your project. Youâ€™ll find we are required to comply with the latest standards, regulations and codes for the work we do for you. This covers everything from how we install certain appliances, to the safety gear we must wear on the job. It also outlines the limits to our work. This ensures you enjoy a standard of safety and quality in all jobs we do, and your liability is limited if we fail to comply with any of them.</p>
